# 🏢 Optimizing Service Efficiency at The Commons  
### 🎯 A Discrete-Event Simulation Approach Using SIMIO

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on enhancing service flow and reducing wait times at **The Commons**, a high-traffic service location. Using **SIMIO**, a discrete-event simulation tool, we analyzed bottlenecks and tested various operational strategies to improve throughput, resource utilization, and customer satisfaction.
